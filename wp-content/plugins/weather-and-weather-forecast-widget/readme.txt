== Frequently Asked Questions ==

<strong>Is there a detailed reference manual coming with the widget?</strong><br />
All you have to know about customizing and setting the widget is written in the manual. The pdf-manual is available in a German and English version. Just follow the help-links in the control panel.<br />
<strong>How can i install the widget more than one time?</strong><br />
That’s very easy! Just have a quick look into the manual!<br />
<strong>Where can i get additional image sets?</strong><br />
There are lots to be finding on the net. A few can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.go-gadget-blog.com">www.go-gadget-blog.com</a><br />
<strong>What is the Auto-Location-Feature?</strong><br />
If you don't want to show the weather for a given location and want to surprise your site visitors by showing their weather, this is the option to choose! The weather widget will then locate users home by some free geolocation services and present the weather and a forecast from there!<a href="http://www.go-gadget-blog.com">www.go-gadget-blog.com</a><br />
<strong>Does the widget slow down my side? How can I prevent this?</strong>
The weather of a given location normally doesn’t change every minute! So allow the widget to cache the weather data for approximately an hour. This helps in two things: The server of weather.com doesn't have to handle too many quests for weather data and your site should speed up a little bit, because your user will see the cached data! 

Nevertheless, if you decide to use the auto-location-feature it doesn’t make any sense to cache the weather data, it has to be produced every time your visitors show up. So you can’t avoid this traffic. 
You neither can avoid, that the widget have to get all the information about your user’s location. This needs a further connection to three, up to four additional servers all over the world. If this slows your server and the connection down too much, i am sorry, but then you should consider not using this feature.

== Upgrade Notice ==

If you upgrade from a previous version - please refer to the Installation section of this text 
<strong>Why should you upgrade?</strong>
If you are using Version 2.0, you should upgrade if
* You are using the auto-location feature or think about using it! I had to bug fix an error concerning possible timeouts of the iplocation services
* You are using a "wider" widget area (footer area or typical magazine style theme) the widget now can be adjusted in width! Looks smoother!
* You are using the German version - about 200 new German text phrases
* Like to have your title within the widget
* You simply like to keep your blog actual...
If you are still running Version 1.x you should really think of upgrading: 
* There are lots of new features you gonna love! 
* New image sets, size adjustments of images as well, embedded CSS makes it comfortable ann easy to get a wonderful fit in your theme!
* Your site visitor will love the Auto-Location feature and  be surprised having "their" weather on "your" site!
* The extended (text) forecast to all-in-all ten days of weather forecast gets all weather information you can think of to your site!
* You'll love the detailed weather texts in English or German, which read very well and gives you the total overview of what will go on!
* Although the previous version wasn't too buggy at all, i was reported of some bugs and found some as well, which i eliminated.<br />
* I was also able to solve a common problem of a server setting failure, which prevents some of the sites running my widget! So if you haven’t been able to get it run earlier - I am quite sure, this version will rock your site! <br />
